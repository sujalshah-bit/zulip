# Lock a topic

{!moderator-only.md!}

Zulip's [topics](/help/introduction-to-topics) are useful for organizing conversations in various contexts like support, project discussions, or announcements. Locking a topic allows moderators to prevent further posts in a topic that has reached a conclusion or needs to be restricted.

Locking topics can help manage conversations effectively by restricting further posts, especially in scenarios like:

* **Concluded discussions**: When the conversation has reached a natural conclusion
  and no further input is required.
* **Contentious or sensitive topics**: Where continued posts might cause problems,
  moderators can lock the topic to control the discussion.
* **Announcements**: Preventing any follow-up messages in an announcement topic to
  keep the focus  clear.

Who can lock or unlock a topic?

* Only authorized users can lock or unlock topics.
* Once a topic is locked, only authorized users can continue to post in it.
